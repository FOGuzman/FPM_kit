% 1) specify where the data located in 'filedir'
% 2) specify where you want to store the results in 'out_dir'
% 3) Find coordinates for estimating background levels and input into 'bk1'
% and 'bk2'.
% 4) specify a threshold value, above which the estimated background value
% is signal rather than noise.
% 5) make sure the LED index (used for taking the images) are properly defined
% in 'lit'
